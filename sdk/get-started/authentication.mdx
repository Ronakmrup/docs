## Overview

Sanas SDK uses secure credential-based authentication to protect access to SDK resources. Before you can use the SDK, you need to request access and receive your unique credentials.

<Info>
  **What you'll receive:**

  - SDK Connector (native libraries and dependencies)
  - Endpoint URL (for Sanas Cloud connection)
  - Account ID (unique identifier)
  - Account Secret (secure password)
</Info>

---

## Request SDK Access

Fill out the access request form to get started:

<Card title="Request SDK Access" icon="mailbox-flag-up" iconType="duotone" href="https://share-na2.hsforms.com/1EScdGvwoQgqBiwZyic04dAczvqf">
  **What to expect:**

  1. Fill out the form with your use case details
  2. Our team will review your request (typically within 1-2 business days)
  3. Receive SDK connector and credentials via email
  4. Start building!

</Card>

### Information Needed

When requesting access, be prepared to provide:

- **Company name** and **use case description**
- **Expected usage volume** (concurrent streams, daily minutes)
- **Deployment preference** (Sanas Cloud or self-hosted)
- **Technical contact** information
- **Preferred region** (if available)

---

## Understanding Your Credentials

Once approved, you'll receive the following via email:

### 1. SDK Connector

**File:** `sanas_remote_sdk_<platform-arch>_<version>.tar.gz`

**File includes:**

- Native Python libraries
- Required dependencies
- Installation script
- Documentation

### 2. Endpoint URL

**Example**: wss://api-mumbai.sanas.ai or similar

**What it is:**

- Network address to connect to the Sanas Cloud
- Region-specific endpoint for low latency

<Note>
  **Self-hosted users:** You won't use this endpoint. Instead, you'll connect to your own infrastructure.
</Note>

### 3. Account ID

**What it is:**

- Unique identifier for your Sanas account
- Used to authenticate SDK requests
- Non-sensitive (but don't share publicly)

### 4. Account Secret

**What it is:**

- Secure password for SDK authentication
- Sensitive credential (keep confidential)
- Used to verify your identity

<Warning>
  **Security Warning:**

  - Never commit the Account Secret to version control
  - Never share in public forums or documentation
  - Rotate immediately if compromised
  - Use environment variables in production
</Warning>

## Complete Authentication Example

Here's how to use your credentials to initialize the SDK:

```python
import sanas_remote_sdk
import os

# Create SDK instance
sdk = sanas_remote_sdk.CreateRemoteSDK()

# Configure initialization parameters
init_params = sanas_remote_sdk.InitParams()

# Set credentials (use environment variables in production)
init_params.remoteEndpoint = os.getenv("SANAS_ENDPOINT", "your_endpoint_url")
init_params.accountId = os.getenv("SANAS_ACCOUNT_ID", "your_account_id")
init_params.accountSecret = os.getenv("SANAS_ACCOUNT_SECRET", "your_account_secret")

# Enable secure media transmission
init_params.secureMedia = True

# Initialize connection
result = sdk.Initialize(init_params)

if result == sanas_remote_sdk.InitResult.SUCCESS:
    print("✅ SDK initialized successfully")
else:
    print(f"❌ Initialization failed: {result}")
```

## Self-Hosted Authentication

If you're deploying Sanas SDK on your own infrastructure:

<Info>
  **Self-hosted differences:**

  - No Endpoint URL needed (you control the infrastructure)
  - You'll receive different deployment-specific credentials
  - Setup requires consultation with the Sanas support team
</Info>

To get started with self-hosting:

<Card title="Contact Support for Self-Hosting" icon="server" href="/support">
  Self-hosted deployment requires:

  - Infrastructure requirements assessment
  - Custom deployment package
  - Architecture guidance
  - Setup assistance
