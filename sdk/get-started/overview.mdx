## What is Sanas SDK?

Sanas SDK is a cloud-hosted software development kit that provides real-time AI-powered speech processing for voice applications. It enables developers to enhance audio quality and improve ASR performance in noisy, real-world environments through live audio streaming.

### Key Capabilities

## How It Works

Sanas SDK operates as a **cloud-hosted real-time streaming service** that processes audio with low latency:

### Technical Architecture

**Connection Protocol:**

- **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol):** Establishes and manages the connection.
- **RTC (Real-Time Communication):** Transmits audio streams.

**Processing Mode:**

- Real-time streaming only (offline processing not currently supported)
- Audio processed in chunks as it arrives
- Maintained session state for continuous streams

### How Audio Flows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your application captures audio">
    Microphone input or live audio stream from your voice pipeline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish SIP connection">
    The SDK connector establishes a secure connection to the Sanas Cloud using SIP.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stream audio via RTC">
    Audio chunks are transmitted in real-time using the RTC protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI processing">
    Selected AI model processes each chunk with ~40ms latency.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive a clean audio stream">
    Enhanced audio is returned in real time via RTC.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use enhanced audio">
    Send to ASR, encoder, or playback device immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>
