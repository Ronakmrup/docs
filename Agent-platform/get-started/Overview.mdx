## Introduction

<Info>
  You are currently viewing documentation for our **Agent platform**. We offer solutions for both AI agents and human users.

Sanas Speech AI SDK is a server-hosted SDK that leverages Sanas’ cutting-edge speech AI technologies to improve the performance of your existing deployed voice AI agents.

Our easy-to-deploy solutions produce results that you can measure from day one.

Speech AI SDK works using the following two main components:

- **SDK connector**: a set of libraries and dependencies that you need to authenticate and access resources from the hosted SDK, and to manage requests and responses with the server.
- **AI engine** - the hosted SDK that contains the AI models, ready to load and process audio streams on request.
