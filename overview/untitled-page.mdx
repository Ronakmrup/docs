## Popular Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Improve Voice Assistant ASR Accuracy" icon="microphone">
    **Challenge:** Your voice agent misunderstands users in noisy environments (cafes, streets, offices).

    **Solution:** Use **AI Voice Agent** model to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by 5-30%.

    **Quick Start:**

    ```python
    # 30-second example
    from sanas_sdk import create_sdk
    
    sdk = create_sdk(endpoint="...", account_id="...", secret="...")
    processor = sdk.create_processor(model="ASR_NC3.0_VAD0.6")
    
    clean_audio = processor.process(noisy_audio)
    # Pass to your ASR (Google, Deepgram, etc.)
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove Background Noise from Calls" icon="phone-volume">
    **Challenge:** Contact center calls have background chatter, keyboard noise, and office sounds.

    **Solution:** Use the**Noise Cancellation**  model to isolate the speaker's voice.

    **Quick Start:**

    ```python
    from sanas_sdk import create_sdk
    
    sdk = create_sdk(endpoint="...", account_id="...", secret="...")
    processor = sdk.create_processor(model="VI-G", confidence=1.0)
    
    clean_audio = processor.process(noisy_call_audio)
    ```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Process Multiple Concurrent Calls" icon="phone-office">
    **Challenge:** Handle 100+ concurrent calls in a contact center.

    **Solution:** SDK supports unlimited concurrent streams with one instance.

    [Multi-Stream Tutorial →](/sdk/tutorials/multi-stream)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Self-Host for Data Compliance" icon="server">
    **Challenge:** Regulatory requirements prevent sending audio to external servers.
