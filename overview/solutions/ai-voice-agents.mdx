## Overview

Voice AI agents struggle with speech recognition in real-world environments. Background noise, chatter, and ambient sounds increase Word Error Rates (WER), leading to misunderstandings and poor user experience.

The **AI Voice Agent** model solves this by applying specialized noise cancellation optimized for ASR pipelines—preserving acoustic features that speech recognition models need while removing distracting noise.

**Result:** 5-30% WER improvement without degradation on clean audio.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Capture audio from user">
    A microphone captures the user's speech in a noisy environment (cafe, office, street).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process through Sanas AI Voice Agent">
    Model removes background noise while preserving phonetic information for ASR
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send clean audio to your ASR">
    Works with any ASR: Deepgram, Google, Whisper, Azure, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get accurate transcription">
    Lower WER means better downstream NLP and conversation quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```python
import sanas_remote_sdk

# Initialize SDK
sdk = sanas_remote_sdk.CreateRemoteSDK()
init_params = sanas_remote_sdk.InitParams()
init_params.remoteEndpoint = "your_endpoint"
init_params.accountId = "your_account_id"
init_params.accountSecret = "your_account_secret"
sdk.Initialize(init_params)

# Create AI Voice Agent processor
audio_params = sanas_remote_sdk.AudioParams()
audio_params.modelName = "ASR_NC3.0_VAD0.6"
audio_params.sampleRate = 16000

processor, result = sdk.CreateAudioProcessor(audio_params, state_callback)

# Process audio in real-time
for chunk in audio_stream:
    clean_audio = processor.ProcessSamples(chunk)
    # Send clean_audio to your ASR
```
